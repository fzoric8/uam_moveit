# uam_ros_pkg

ROS pkg for aerial manipulators used on `kopterworx` UAV. 

Currently configured for the `ASAP` manipulator which has quite simple configuration. 

## TODO: 

- [ ] Enable simple control of the manipulator 
- [ ] Write control node for the manipulator in the ROS pkg `uam_ctl`
- [ ] Test on real UAM
